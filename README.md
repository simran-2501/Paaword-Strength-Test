# Password Strength Tester

## **Description**
The Password Strength Tester is a Python desktop application built with Tkinter that analyzes how strong a password is. It evaluates:

- Length
- Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)
- Entropy (mathematical strength)
- Estimated brute-force cracking time
- Exposure in known data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API

The tool provides real-time scoring and suggestions to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.
